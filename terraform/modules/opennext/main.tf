# apps/web deployed via @opennextjs/aws (next.config.ts / package.json's
# opennext:build script): a "server" Lambda handles every SSR/RSC
# request (this app renders `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` everywhere —
# see app/layout.tsx — so there is no static HTML to fall back to), an
# "image" Lambda handles next/image's on-the-fly resizing, and a plain
# S3 bucket serves the content-hashed /_next/static/* build output.
#
# Deliberately NOT built here: OpenNext's ISR/on-demand-revalidation
# queue+Lambda. This app has no static/ISR pages to revalidate (every
# route opts out of static generation — see app/layout.tsx's comment on
# why), so that piece of the standard OpenNext topology would be dead
# infrastructure. Documented scope cut, not an oversight — revisit if a
# future phase adds any statically-generated route back.
