# Lets the private-isolated tier (RDS-only Lambdas + Directus) reach S3,
# Secrets Manager, EventBridge, CloudWatch Logs, and ECR without a NAT
# Gateway — infrastructure/networking.md. S3 is a free gateway endpoint;
# the rest are small flat-rate interface endpoints, cheaper than routing
# that traffic through NAT once more than a couple of low-volume
# functions are doing it. ecr.api/ecr.dkr were added in Phase 2 —
# Directus's ECS task is the first thing in the isolated tier that
# needs to pull a container image (Lambda deployment packages don't go
# through ECR at all, so nothing needed this before now).
#
# var.create_endpoints = false reuses pre-existing endpoints instead of
# creating new ones for whichever services genuinely already exist in
# the account's reused VPC — the S3 gateway endpoint and the
# secretsmanager interface endpoint, confirmed via a real
# `aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints` (this module's earlier header
# comment claimed "all six" of these pre-existed from an earlier,
# unrelated project; that turned out to be wrong for events/logs/
# ecr.api/ecr.dkr — a live Directus ECS task failing to reach ECR is
# what surfaced it. AWS allows only one private-DNS-enabled interface
# endpoint per service per VPC, so the two that DO already exist can't
# be recreated — a real apply confirmed both the gateway-endpoint route
# conflict and the secretsmanager interface-endpoint private-DNS
# conflict). The remaining services
# (var.interface_endpoints_to_create) are genuinely created by this
# module even when create_endpoints = false, using
# var.endpoint_security_group_id like the create_endpoints = true path
# does — ingress for their actual consumers lives in
# terraform/modules/security-groups, not here.
