# earlier phase's leftover comment in modules/cloudfront originally
# proposed — would mean moving the media origin onto a /media/* path
# behavior, which changes the URL shape every already-merged phase
# (Directus config, apps/api-catalog, etc.) already writes into
# catalog.media_assets.s3_key-derived URLs. Not worth that blast radius
# just to save one distribution; this app gets its own at the bare

  # Every route in this app is `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` (app/layout.tsx
  # — CartLink/AccountLink in the shared header forward the visitor's
  # anonymous_id/auth cookies on every request), so nothing here is
  # cacheable at the edge; this behavior exists to route requests to the
  # server Lambda and forward what it needs, not to cache responses.
  #
  # Uses the modern cache-policy/origin-request-policy resources, not
  # the legacy forwarded_values API — this is AWS's own documented
  # pattern for an origin signed via Origin Access Control (OAC), which
  # computes a SigV4 signature over the request CloudFront actually
  # sends. A first attempt just removed "Host" from forwarded_values'
  # header allowlist (the known reason forwarding Host breaks OAC
  # signing for a custom origin) and that alone wasn't sufficient — a
  # real `curl -v` still showed a 403 AccessDeniedException straight
  # from the Function URL after that fix was live and confirmed applied
  # (every other piece of the OAC/IAM chain was independently verified
  # correct via the AWS CLI: resource policy, SourceArn, AuthType,
  # origin domain). Managed-AllViewerExceptHostHeader is the policy AWS
  # documents specifically for OAC-signed custom origins — it forwards
  # everything the legacy config did (all cookies, all headers except
  # Host, all query strings) through the officially-supported path
  # instead of the legacy one, on the chance the legacy API has some
  # other OAC-signing quirk beyond just the Host header.
