# RDS Proxy connection pooling — fronts the single RDS instance so
# Lambda's high connection churn doesn't exhaust Postgres's own
# connection limit.
#
# Each `auth` block registers one Secrets Manager secret the proxy will
# accept client connections for — it's not just "which secret the proxy
# uses for its own backend connection" (that part is real too, but any
# registered secret also becomes a valid *client*-facing credential).
# The master secret's block has iam_auth governed by
# var.require_iam_auth (true in every real environment) — since RDS
# doesn't support IAM database authentication for the master user at
# all, iam_auth = REQUIRED on that entry means the master user can
# never connect through this proxy by design, password or IAM; anything
# that genuinely needs the master (migration-runner) connects directly
# to RDS instead, bypassing the proxy entirely.
#
# var.additional_auth_secret_arns registers extra secrets with
# iam_auth = DISABLED unconditionally — Directus/Medusa's own DB-role
# passwords (directus_app/medusa_app), whose Postgres clients (Knex)
# have no dynamic IAM token refresh support, so they connect with a
# stored password instead (infrastructure/secrets.md's documented
# exception). Without an entry here, the proxy has no way to validate
# their password at all — confirmed by a real "IAM authentication
# failed" error from a stored-password connection, which is what
# uncovered that this was never wired up despite being the documented
# intent everywhere else in this codebase.
