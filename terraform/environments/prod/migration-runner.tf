# One-off DB migration runner (runbooks/deploy.md §4, option 3). Not
# wired to API Gateway — no HTTP trigger, no route. Applying this file
# changes nothing at runtime by itself; only an explicit
#   aws lambda invoke --function-name pk-literature-prod-migration-runner \
#     --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out --payload '{}' out.json
# ever runs node-pg-migrate against the real RDS instance. Deployment
# package built by apps/migration-runner/scripts/package-lambda.sh —
# must be run before `terraform apply` touches this file, same as
# every other Lambda service.
#
# Connects with the RDS master credential (Secrets Manager, resolved
# at cold start — never a plain Lambda environment variable, per
# infrastructure/secrets.md), not RDS Proxy IAM auth: the app DB roles
# each service's own migrations grant (catalog_api_readonly, etc.)
# don't exist until api-catalog's migrations create them, so nothing
# but the master user can run migrations from a cold start.
#
# Connects DIRECTLY to RDS, bypassing RDS Proxy entirely — confirmed by
# a real "IAM authentication failed for the role pk_literature_admin"
# error that a stored-password connection through the proxy produces.
# RDS doesn't support IAM database authentication for the master user
# at all, and the proxy's master auth entry deliberately keeps
# iam_auth = REQUIRED (modules/rds-proxy's header comment), so no
# master connection — password or IAM — can ever succeed through the
# proxy. Uses its own dedicated security group
# (security-groups' migration_runner SG) rather than reusing
# lambda_db_sg_id, since this is the one Lambda with direct network
# access to RDS's own port — keeping that grant scoped to exactly this
# function.
