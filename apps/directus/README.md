# Directus (Editorial Workbench)

SPEC-03's Editorial Workbench. The running service is the official
`directus/directus` image with one custom Flow operation extension
baked in — there is no application code of our own beyond that
extension and the config-as-code bootstrap script in this directory.

## Layout

- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage build: compiles
  `extensions/operations/eventbridge-put-event` with its own toolchain,
  then layers the result onto the pinned upstream `directus/directus`
  image. Built and pushed to the shared ECR repo
  (`terraform/bootstrap/ecr.tf`) by
  `.github/workflows/build-directus-image.yml` — the running ECS task
  sits in the private-isolated subnet tier with no NAT/internet route
  (ADR-009's reasoning, applied to ECS instead of Lambda), so it can
  never pull from Docker Hub directly.
- `extensions/operations/eventbridge-put-event/` — a custom Directus
  Flow "operation" extension. Backs SPEC-03's "Trigger catalog publish
  event" flow: it calls EventBridge `PutEvents` directly via
  `@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge`, running in Directus's main Node
  process under the ECS task's own IAM role
  (`infrastructure/iam.md`'s direct `ecs-directus` → `events:PutEvents`
  grant). This is why it's a real extension and not Flows' built-in
  "Run Script" operation — that runs in a sandboxed VM with no AWS SDK
  or outbound network access by design; only a real extension gets the
  task role's credentials.
- `scripts/bootstrap.ts` — config-as-code: tracks the `catalog` +
  `staging` Postgres tables as Directus collections
  (`plan/contracts/directus/collections.md`) and creates the Catalog
  Editor / Senior Editor roles + policies + permissions from SPEC-03.
  Run with `DIRECTUS_URL`, `DIRECTUS_ADMIN_EMAIL`,
  `DIRECTUS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` set: `pnpm --filter directus run bootstrap`.
  Idempotent — safe to re-run.

## Known issue — bootstrap not live-verified

Every migration/Terraform/extension-build/typecheck step in this phase
was validated for real (see each file's own comments for specifics).
The one thing that could **not** be validated end-to-end is a running
Directus instance: both Directus 11.17.4 and 12.1.1 crashed during
first-boot bootstrap in this sandbox, at the built-in
`20251014A-add-project-owner` migration, with an error trying to
introspect `public.pgmigrations`. This reproduced identically against a
completely empty, isolated database with none of this repo's schemas
or tables present — proving it is not caused by anything in this repo
(our migrations, our grants, our schema layout). It looks like a
genuine bug in those Directus versions triggered by something specific
to this sandbox's Postgres/Node environment; it may well not reproduce
on RDS Postgres in real AWS. Directus 10.13.4 was tried as a further
data point but failed to even `npm install` here (a native module,
`isolated-vm`, fails to build via `node-gyp` in this sandbox) —
inconclusive either way.

Practical consequence: `scripts/bootstrap.ts` and the collection/role/
permission design in this README are written carefully against
Directus's documented API and typechecked against the real
`@directus/sdk` v17 type definitions (no live server needed for that —
`pnpm --filter directus run typecheck` passes), but neither the
bootstrap script nor the `eventbridge-put-event` extension's runtime
behavior have been round-tripped against an actual running Directus.
Treat both as reviewed-but-untested. Before relying on this in a real
environment: bring up the ECS task in dev, confirm it boots cleanly
(if it doesn't, this same crash needs to be root-caused against a real
Directus issue tracker/version bump — it is not a "fix our config"
problem based on the evidence above), then run the bootstrap script
and manually verify a Catalog Editor and Senior Editor account behave
as SPEC-03 describes before treating either role as trustworthy.

## Deliberately out of scope for this pass

- **M:N junction fields** (`work_authors`, `book_contributors`,
  `work_themes`, `work_genres`, `work_literary_movements`,
  `book_collections`) — `plan/contracts/directus/collections.md` calls
  for these to be exposed as Directus's built-in M:N alias relationship
  fields rather than separate browsable collections. Wiring that via
  the Relations API is finicky and version-sensitive; it's left as a
  follow-up once there's a live instance to iterate against. In the
  meantime, Directus will still auto-detect the plain FK columns
  (`books.work_id`, `books.publisher_id`, etc.) as ordinary many-to-one
  relations once both sides are tracked collections — only the
  many-to-many junction UX is missing, not basic relational navigation.
- **AI Assisted Enrichment** flows (SPEC-03) — explicitly listed there
  as a future capability, not part of this phase.
